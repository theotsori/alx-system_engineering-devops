<p>The REST API used in this task is the JSONPlaceholder API. It provides a mock server to simulate a RESTful API for testing and prototyping purposes. It offers various resources, such as posts, comments, users, albums, photos, todos, and more. These resources can be accessed using HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to their respective endpoints, with data returned in JSON format.</p>
<p>Specifically, for the task of returning information about an employee's TODO list progress, we use the /todos endpoint to retrieve the employee's todo list, filtered by their userId. The response includes an array of todos, each with a title and completed flag. We also use the /users endpoint to retrieve the employee's name, which is included in the response as name. By parsing the response, we can determine the number of completed tasks and total tasks, and display this information along with the employee's name and the titles of the completed tasks, in the required format.</p>
