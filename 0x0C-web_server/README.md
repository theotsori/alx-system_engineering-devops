A web server is a computer program that responds to requests from web clients, such as web browsers, and delivers web content such as web pages, images, videos, and other resources over the internet. A web server typically consists of hardware, software, and network infrastructure.

The software component of a web server is responsible for processing incoming requests from web clients and sending back the requested content in response. Popular web server software includes Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, Microsoft IIS, and Google Web Server.

A web server can host multiple websites or web applications, each with its own domain name, and can serve static or dynamic content. A static web server delivers web pages that do not change in response to user input, while a dynamic web server can generate content on the fly based on user requests and interactions.

Web servers can also provide other services, such as email services, database access, and authentication and authorization services.
