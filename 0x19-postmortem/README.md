<p>Technical postmortems are essential in identifying weaknesses in a system, infrastructure, or application and can help organizations improve their reliability, performance, and user experience. By conducting a thorough analysis of an outage or incident, organizations can gain valuable insights into their system and identify areas of improvement to prevent similar incidents in the future.
