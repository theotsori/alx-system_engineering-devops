The chart illustrates the main differences between the two protocols, including the security features and the potential vulnerabilities associated with each one.
<br>
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is an application protocol used for transmitting data over the internet. It is the foundation of the World Wide Web and is used for accessing websites and other online resources. However, HTTP does not provide any encryption or security features, which means that any data transmitted over an HTTP connection can be intercepted and read by anyone who has access to the network.
<br>
On the other hand, HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is a more secure version of HTTP that uses encryption to protect the data transmitted between the user's browser and the website's server. This encryption is provided by an SSL/TLS (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) certificate, which ensures that the data cannot be intercepted or modified by anyone other than the intended recipient.

The chart provided by Sucuri highlights the key differences between HTTP and HTTPS, including the security features, potential vulnerabilities, and the impact on search engine optimization (SEO). It also provides recommendations on how to switch from HTTP to HTTPS and the importance of keeping SSL/TLS certificates up to date to ensure maximum security.
