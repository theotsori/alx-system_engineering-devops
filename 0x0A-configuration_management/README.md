Configuration management refers to the process of managing and maintaining the settings and configurations of systems and applications in a consistent and automated way. It involves using tools and techniques to ensure that systems are configured according to desired state, which can help to minimize errors, reduce downtime, and improve overall system reliability and security.

Configuration management systems (CMS) automate the process of deploying and managing software, hardware, and network configurations across multiple systems. These tools allow administrators to define the desired configuration state of a system or group of systems, and then automatically enforce that state on all relevant systems.

Popular configuration management tools include Puppet, Ansible, Chef, and SaltStack. These tools provide a framework for defining, deploying, and managing infrastructure as code, allowing administrators to version control their configurations and easily reproduce and deploy them to other systems.

Configuration management can help organizations to streamline and automate their IT operations, reduce the likelihood of errors, and ensure consistency across their infrastructure. It is an essential component of DevOps practices, as it allows for rapid and reliable deployment of software and infrastructure changes.
