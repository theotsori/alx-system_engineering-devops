SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely connect to a remote computer or server over an unsecured network. It allows for encrypted communication between the client (your computer) and the server, ensuring that data such as login credentials or sensitive information is protected from eavesdropping, tampering, or other types of attacks.

SSH can be used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Remote command-line access to a server or computer
File transfer (using tools like SCP or SFTP)
Port forwarding (allowing you to access a service running on a remote server through an encrypted connection)
Tunneling (allowing you to encrypt traffic between two endpoints, such as between your computer and a web server)

SSH uses public-key cryptography to authenticate the client and server and establish a secure connection. When you connect to a remote server using SSH, you typically need to provide a username and password or a private key file to authenticate yourself.

SSH is widely used in the IT industry for managing servers, deploying code, and performing various administrative tasks. It is available on most Unix-based systems (including Linux and macOS) and can also be used on Windows with the help of third-party software.
