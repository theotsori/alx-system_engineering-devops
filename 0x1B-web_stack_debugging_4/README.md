To improve a server's performance, there are several measures that can be taken. The first step is to analyze the server's configuration and optimize it for better performance. This can involve tuning the server's kernel parameters, adjusting its caching and compression settings, and optimizing its resource usage. It's also important to ensure that the server's software is up-to-date, with the latest patches and security updates installed. Additionally, you can consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to reduce the server's load and improve website speed.   
The second step is to ensure that the server's hardware is adequate for the workload. This includes making sure that the server has enough CPU, RAM, and storage to handle the traffic. You can also consider upgrading to faster storage or using SSDs, which can improve I/O performance. Finally, load balancing and scaling the server can be another effective way to improve its performance. By distributing the workload across multiple servers, you can ensure that no single server is overloaded and that your website remains available and responsive even during peak traffic periods.
