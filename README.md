<p>System engineering and DevOps are two distinct concepts in the field of
software development and IT operations. System engineering involves the process
of designing, building, and maintaining complex systems, while DevOps is a
set of practices that combines software development and IT operations to enable
organizations to deliver software more rapidly and reliably.</p>
<br>
<p>In practice, system engineering and DevOps often overlap, as both involve designing and maintaining complex systems. System engineers may work closely with DevOps teams to ensure that software applications are designed in a way that can be easily deployed and maintained. DevOps teams, in turn, may rely on system engineers to help design and configure the underlying infrastructure needed to support their applications.</p>
<br>
<p>Overall, system engineering and DevOps are complementary approaches to software development and operations. By combining the two, organizations can build and maintain software systems that are both robust and responsive to changing business needs. The goal is to create a system that meets the needs of its users and performs reliably by emphasizing collaboration, communication, and automation between development teams and operations teams.</p>
