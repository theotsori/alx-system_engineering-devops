<h1>Load Balancer</h1>
<img src="https://www.appviewx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/what-is-a-load-balancer.png">
A load balancer is a device or software that is used to distribute network traffic across multiple servers or resources in a network. It acts as a mediator between clients and servers, receiving incoming network traffic and routing it to one of several servers that are available to handle the request.

In the image, there are two clients that are sending requests to a load balancer. The load balancer then distributes the traffic to three different servers in the back-end, which can handle the requests. The load balancer is responsible for monitoring the health of the servers and ensuring that traffic is distributed evenly among them.

Load balancing is an essential component of any high-traffic website or application, as it helps to ensure that the service remains available and responsive even during periods of high demand. By distributing traffic across multiple servers, a load balancer can also help to prevent overloading of any individual server, which can lead to slower response times or even downtime.
