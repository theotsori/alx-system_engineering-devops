<p>Web stack debugging involves identifying and resolving issues within the various layers of a web application's technology stack. To debug a web application, you need to first reproduce the issue to understand its context and impact. Then, check the application logs, network traffic, database, and server configuration to identify the root cause of the problem. It's also important to test the code using various testing methodologies and use a debugger to step through the code and identify any unexpected behavior or runtime errors. By following these steps, you can effectively debug a web application and resolve any issues that may arise.</p>
