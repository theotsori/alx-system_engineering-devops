<h2>What is a PID</h2>
<P>A PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controller is a type of feedback control system commonly used in industrial control systems and other applications that require continuously modulated control. A PID controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between a desired setpoint and a measured process variable and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (P, I, and D respectively) which give the controller its name. The proportional term provides a correction that is proportional to the error, the integral term provides a correction that is proportional to the accumulated error over time, and the derivative term provides a correction that is proportional to the rate of change of the error. These three terms are combined to generate a control signal that will bring the process variable close to the setpoint.</P>
<br><h2>What is a process</h2>
<p>A process is a series of actions or steps taken in order to achieve a specific result or outcome. It can refer to a variety of different things, depending on the context. In general, a process is a systematic and organized way of achieving a specific goal or objective.
In terms of industrial control systems, a process refers to a specific industrial operation or production process that is being controlled or monitored by a process control system. It could be anything from a manufacturing process to a chemical reaction, a physical change, or a biological process. The process variable is the measured output of the process which can be temperature, pressure, flow, level, etc. The goal of the process control system is to control the process variable to match a desired setpoint or target.</p>
