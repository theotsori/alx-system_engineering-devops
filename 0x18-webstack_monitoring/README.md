Webstack monitoring refers to the process of monitoring and analyzing the performance, availability, and health of the components that make up a web application, such as servers, databases, and networks. This is done through the use of various monitoring tools and techniques, including logging, metrics, and alerting, which help identify and diagnose issues in real-time, as well as provide insights into trends and patterns over time. By monitoring the webstack, teams can optimize the performance of their web applications, ensure their reliability, and deliver a better user experience to their customers.
