- An application server is a software framework or container that provides an environment for running and managing applications. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the server-side applications, handling tasks such as request processing, data persistence, security, and scalability. The primary purpose of an application server is to host and execute web-based applications and services, providing the necessary infrastructure and services for their operation.   

- Application servers typically include features such as web server capabilities, support for multiple programming languages, database connectivity, session management, and load balancing. They allow developers to deploy and manage applications more efficiently by providing a standardized and scalable runtime environment. Application servers are commonly used in enterprise environments to host mission-critical applications and web services, enabling organizations to deliver reliable and high-performance solutions to their users.   

- In summary, an application server is a software framework that provides the infrastructure and services for hosting and executing web-based applications. It simplifies the deployment and management of applications, improves scalability and performance, and ensures the reliable delivery of services to end-users.
