Debugging a web stack involves identifying and fixing issues at every layer of the web application stack, which includes the front-end (client-side), back-end (server-side), and database. Here are some general tips for debugging each layer:
<br>
<h2>Front-end debugging:</h2>
Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.
Use browser developer tools to inspect the page's HTML and CSS code, as well as network requests and responses.
Try to reproduce the issue in different browsers or devices to see if it's specific to a particular environment.
Check if any third-party libraries or plugins are causing conflicts or errors.
<h2>Back-end debugging:</h2>
Check the server logs for any errors or exceptions.
Use a debugger to step through the code and identify where the issue is occurring.
Check the database for any incorrect or missing data.
Ensure that all necessary server-side dependencies and configurations are properly set up.
<h2>Database debugging:</h2>
Check the database logs for any errors or warnings.
Use a database management tool to inspect the data and schema for any issues.
Check if any queries are taking too long to execute or returning unexpected results.
Ensure that the database is properly configured and optimized for performance.

Overall, debugging a web stack requires a systematic approach to identify and isolate the issue, and then use the appropriate tools and techniques to fix it.
