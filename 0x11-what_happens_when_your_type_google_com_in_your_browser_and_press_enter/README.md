<p>When you type "google.com" in your browser and press enter, your browser sends a request to the server that hosts the Google website. The server then responds by sending the website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to your browser.</p>
<p>Your browser then interprets this information and renders the Google homepage for you to see. The homepage includes a search box and other links that allow you to navigate to different parts of the website.</p>
<p>In addition to the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, the server may also send additional resources, such as images or videos, that are embedded in the webpage. These resources are requested by your browser separately and are displayed on the webpage as they load.</p>
<p>Once the webpage is fully loaded, you can interact with it by clicking on links, typing search queries into the search box, or performing other actions. Your browser will send additional requests to the server as needed to retrieve new content or resources.</p>
