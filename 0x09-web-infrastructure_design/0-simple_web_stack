Lets assume a user wants to access the website, www.foobar.com. When the user enters the URL in their web browser, a request is sent to the DNS server to resolve the domain name to an IP address. The DNS server looks up the domain name and returns the IP address of the server that hosts the website.

What is a server: 
	A server is a computer system that provides services to other computers, referred to as clients, over a network either private or wide area. In our case, we will use a single server to host the website.

What is role of the domain Name:
	A domain name is a human-readable address that is used to locate and identify computer systems on the Internet. The role of the domain name is to provide a unique and memorable name that is easier to remember than an IP address.

What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com:
	The www record in www.foobar.com is a subdomain of the domain foobar.com. It is a DNS record that maps the subdomain to an IP address.

What is the role of the web server:
	Nginx is a web server that is commonly used to serve static content such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. It can also be used to proxy requests to an application server.

What is the role of the application server:
	An application server is a server that hosts an application's business logic. In our case, we will use an application server to host our code base.

What is the role of the database:
	MySQL is a relational database management system that is commonly used in web applications. It is used to store and retrieve data.

What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website:
	The server communicates with the user's computer over the Internet using the HTTP protocol.

Possible issues with this infrastructure:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF):
	Since we are using a single server, it becomes a single point of failure. If the server goes down, the website becomes inaccessible.

Downtime during maintenance:
	During maintenance, such as deploying new code, the web server needs to be restarted, resulting in downtime.

Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic:
	Since we are using a single server, it cannot handle a large amount of incoming traffic. If the traffic exceeds the server's capacity, the website may become slow or even crash.
