<h1>Web infrastructure design</h1>
<p>A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack.</p>

Web infrastructure design refers to the process of designing and implementing the technical architecture and components that support the operation of a web application or website. This includes the hardware, software, network, and storage components that are needed to support the application, as well as the security and scalability considerations that must be taken into account.

The design of a web infrastructure typically begins with the identification of the application's requirements, such as the expected traffic volume, the types of data being processed, and the desired level of availability and reliability. Based on these requirements, the designer will choose appropriate hardware and software components, such as servers, databases, load balancers, and caching systems.

The infrastructure design must also take into account security considerations, such as protection against attacks like denial-of-service (DoS) and cross-site scripting (XSS), as well as data privacy and compliance with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Finally, the web infrastructure design should be scalable and flexible, so that it can accommodate changes in traffic volume or application requirements over time. This may involve the use of cloud-based services or virtualization technologies to increase or decrease capacity as needed.
