<p>Web stack debugging involves the process of identifying, isolating, and resolving issues that occur within the various layers of a web application's technology stack. The technology stack is composed of multiple layers such as the front-end, back-end, database, and web server. When an issue arises, developers use various debugging tools and techniques to locate the root cause of the problem. This may involve inspecting code, monitoring server logs, checking database queries, and analyzing network traffic. Once the issue is identified, developers can then work on fixing it by updating code, modifying database queries, or changing server configurations. Effective web stack debugging requires a systematic approach and strong technical skills in web development and troubleshooting.
